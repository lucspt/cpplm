# cpplm

Hey, welcome to `cpplm`. It's a mini project through which i'm learning c++.

Currently, it contains a couple pytorch (libtorch in this context) modules and a
decoder-only transformer based language model.

The model implementation is quite similar to another project of mine,
[`talm`](https://github.com/lucspt/talm).

That's pretty much it, lol. Make yourself at home!
