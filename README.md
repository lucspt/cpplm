# cpplm

Hey, welcome to `cpplm`. It's a mini project through which i'm sharpening my c++ skills.

Currently, it contains a couple pytorch (libtorch in this context) modules and a
decoder-only transformer based language model.

The model implementation is quite similar to another project of mine,
[`talm`](https://github.com/lucspt/talm). You can follow the steps 
there to train your own language model if you'd like.

That's pretty much it. Feel free to make yourself at home!
